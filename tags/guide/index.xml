      <description>Notice me, focus on me, look at me.&#xA;I always talk to myself about the following question: How should I proceed to become a successful man like my father or my grandfather? But I have never arrived at a final answer. I can&amp;rsquo;t even emulate them when they were as young as I am now. Therefore, I promise myself that I will do my utmost to become a better man than they were.</description>
